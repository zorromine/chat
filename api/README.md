request -> mux(router) -> sql generated code -> database -> sql

## library used

1. sqlc to connect go code to sql (sql is mostly generated by chatgpt)
2. mux as router

When it comes to building web applications with Go, there are several choices for libraries and frameworks. One of the most popular options for creating a web server is mux, which provides a flexible and powerful routing system.

In addition to handling incoming requests and routing them to the appropriate handler, a web application will typically need to interact with a database. This is where sqlc comes in, a Go library that helps connect your Go code to your database using SQL.

Using these two tools together, you can quickly create a powerful and efficient web application that uses SQL for data storage and retrieval.

Here's how it all fits together. When a request comes into your application, it's handled by mux. Mux inspects the incoming request and routes it to the appropriate function or handler in your Go code.

Your Go code, in turn, uses sqlc generated go code (based on SQL) that interacts with your database. This generated go code is used to fetch data, store new data, and update existing data. The SQL code is compiled and executed by your database, and the result is returned to your Go code.

Overall, this architecture provides a clean and modular approach to building web applications with Go. By leveraging powerful libraries like mux and sqlc, you can focus on writing application logic rather than worrying about the low-level details of routing and database access.

In summary, if you're building a web application with Go, you should definitely consider using mux as your router and sqlc to connect your Go code to your database. The combination of these two libraries makes it easy to build scalable and reliable web applications that are both easy to maintain and performant.
