"""
Note that this program uses the `difflib` module to apply the diff. The `difflib.unified_diff()` function takes two lists of strings (the contents of the original file and the diff file) and returns a generator that yields the patched lines. The `writelines()` function is used to write the patched lines to a new file.

Also note that the program includes an optional step to rename the original file and rename the patched file to the original file name. This is done to preserve the original file in case the patching process goes wrong.
